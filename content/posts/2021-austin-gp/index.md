Another good race behind.

## Quick five-point-summary about the race

+ Holy hell, Max can take the pressure.
+ Lewis is still strong, but this should hurt given he's done all but lost to strategy.
+ Redbull and Mercedes are head to head mostly. Who's on top usually depends on the track and tyres mostly.
+ Redbull is getting more confident about the strategy while Mercedes struggling when they don't have the performance difference to be confident.
+ 2 stop races are great

## Strategy for the upcoming races

### Redbull

I definitely think Redbull needs good results in Mexico and Brazil. Quatar and Jeddah is up-to-debate, and Abu Dhabi should favor Mercedes more. If they want to win WDC they might need to sacrifece Perez. But given the next race is Mexico, I don't think that will be an easy call to make. Also the engines should last, which means they might not push too hard if they can get away with it.

### Mercedes

Mercedes needs to push it hard for the next two races and get the lead again. They have the advantage with the engine penalty since they just changed Hamilton's ICE. If they can close the gap and keep the reliability, they might push another engine penalty for Max for the last couple of races.

## Ferrari giving hope

Please my heart might not survive another 2014. Please be good next year will you?
